% A bit about the project and what has been given
%   general goal
%       vision goals
%       rob goals
%       AI goals

In this project a simulated environment containing marbles and a robot is given.
With these the goal is to write algorithms to control the robot,
such that navigation and mapping of the simulated environment can be used to collect marbles efficiently.
The fields used in this project to achieve the given goal are robotic path planning,
computer vision and artificial intelligence.\\
To further specify the methods and individual goals for each part of the project, its segmented accordingly to the fields touch upon.
Thus the sub goals are specified as follows.\\ \\

For the computer vision segment the criteria is for the color camera mounted on the robot to detect marbles
independent of their color with a sufficient and robust performance.\\
Alternative methods are studied with the potential for better performance under criteria such as non color independency.\\ \\

For the artificial intelligence segment the criteria and goals are set as such that fuzzy control will be used for local navigation,
while Q-learning will be used for global navigation. By using these Q-learning the environment must be discovered fully,
while fuzzy control handles local obstacle avoidance.\\ \\

For the last segment addressing robot path planning, the criteria of solving global navigation is done by applying a particle
filter along with the map plan. \\ \\
