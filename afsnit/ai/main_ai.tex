\section{AI}%
\label{sec:ai}
As part this project there are 2 sub problems which should make use of fuzzy control
and Q-learning.
The first sub problem is to implement local obstacle avoidance using fuzzy control.

The second sub problem is to apply Q-learning to find effective navigation strategies.
This is done on three different maps.

For a more detail description of the requirements for the problem solutions please refer to appendix
\ref{sub:ai_project_description} provided by Anders Lyhne on Blackcoard.
